How the Report Route Works:

Query Parameters: The route /reports accepts two query parameters: startDate and endDate. 
These define the period for which you want to generate the report.

Example: /reports?startDate=2024-09-01&endDate=2024-09-30

Fetching Sales Data: Using Sequelize's Op.between operator, it fetches sales between the provided dates.

Report Metrics:
Total Revenue: Sum of all totalPrice fields from the sales.
Total Items Sold: Sum of all quantity fields from the sales.
Sales Details: Provides details about each sale, including product ID, name, quantity sold, total price, and sale date.
